# social-network-api

## Description
The goal of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Key Points
1. When user starts the application, the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB
2. When user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each is displayed in a formatted json
3. When user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they're able to create, update, and delete users and thoughts
4. When user tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they're able to create and delete reactions to thoughts, as well as add and remove friends from a user's friend's list
